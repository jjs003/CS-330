# How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is reflective, incremental, and utilitarian. I enjoy bringing ideas to life and have found joy in the assignments for this class. For each assignment, I used knowledge gained through the resources to help create code that properly addressed the rubric. This class provided me with a surplus of new knowledge in the field of computer graphics creation. I now have a solid foundation to build upon in utilizing OpenGL for computer graphics. As I continue to pursue my bachelor's degree in computer science, I am constantly adding to the list of my abilities and knowledge and will continue to use all that I have gained in future classes, projects, and endeavors.

# How do I approach developing programs?
My approach to developing programs is similar to my design approach. I take things as incrementally as possible while constantly checking what I have created for bugs and errors. I create small chunks of code to address a single piece of functionality and test that chunk of code thoroughly before moving on. Specific to the work in this class, I learned to adjust minute details in the positioning, rotation, lighting, and other visual factors in order to most effectively capture the details of a scene. These strategies were developed across each milestone and allowed me to successfully complete my final project.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will be instrumental in helping me reach my goals as I intend to utilize the skills that I am aquiring in the professional world. I hope to find a way to apply my knowledge to something that I can enjoy doing while also supporting my family. The skills attained in this class will likely directly translate to additional opportunities in the future in regard to my professional and educational pathway.
